        Hi! I'm a frontend developer with a B.Tech in Electronics and
        Communication Engineering from SRM Institute of Science and Technology.
        Currently, I'm transitioning to become a full-stack engineer. Passionate
        about creating intuitive UIs, I'm always eager to learn and embrace new
        technologies.
